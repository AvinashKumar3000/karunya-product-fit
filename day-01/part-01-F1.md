## javac Sample.java

- coverting all classes
  to its corresponding .class file.

## java Sample

- First it will try to find Sample.class file. Then it will execute the code.

## java Sample.java

- Directly it will compile and execute the output. without creating any .class file.

- Always Per file, we should have only one
  public class and its name should be same
  as file name.

- can we create a file without any public class ? Yes.

- For generating utility classes. or
  when project is huge. we will keep seperate
  class files for seperate logics.
  At that time, we can create a classes without public keyword.
